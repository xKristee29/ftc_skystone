/**
 * This OpMode ramps a single motor speed up and down repeatedly until Stop is pressed.
 * The code is structured as a LinearOpMode
 *
 * This code assumes a DC motor configured with the name "left_drive" as is found on a pushbot.
 *
 * INCREMENT sets how much to increase/decrease the power each cycle
 * CYCLE_MS sets the update period.
 *
 * Use Android Studio to Copy this Class, and Paste it into your team's code folder with a new name.
 * Remove or comment out the @Disabled line to add this opmode to the Driver Station OpMode list
